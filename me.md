Professional Experience
============

### > [2019  - Present] -- *Teaching Assistant -- Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin (UVSQ) -- France*
As part of the High-Performance and Simulation (CHPS) Master Degree, the
Advanced Architecture of Operating Systems (AISE) lectures attempt to teach, in
a pratical way, how an operating system works, from the basics to more advanced
concepts. Among the covererd subjects:
* Basics for Linux Operating Systems (processes, threads, I/O, network)
* Detailed analysis to compile, link and deal with ELF-based programs
* Memory Management, from hardware resources to user space
* Kernel (Customization, Scheduling, LKM, DKMS...)
* Projects (Shell, Memory Allocator, PMI Emulation)
Beyond lectures, I'm also tutoring pluridisciplinary projects across the
semester (e.g. distributed KVS over MPI).In that context, I share the lead of
this course gathering around 45 hours of teaching a year.

### > [2015 - Present] -- *HPC Junior Developer & Consultant -- ParaTools SAS -- France*

[ParaTools SAS](http://paratools.fr) provides a highly specialized consulting &
expertise support relatively to High performance Computing solutions. Initially
oriented to performance, thanks to the support of [TAU](http://tau.uoregon.edu)
tool, It also provides a large range of expertise when dealing with compilation
and runtime supports. The French affiliate covers a larger area, mainly focused
on developing inside runtimes (MPI, OpenMP). In that context, I contributed to
multiple areas of interest and feed my knowledge among the following:

* GCC and the compilation chain (front-ends, GIMPLE, IR, plugins...)
* High-speed networks and driver optimizations for an MPI runtime (IB, Portals,
  SHMEM, OFI)
* Thread-level Storage mechanism and optimizations to create a custom user-level
  thread support with adaptive hierarchical support, mimicking the same
  capabilities as usually exposed with a regular `__thread` keyword. 
* Accelerators, mainly CUDA-capable devices.
* Broad knowledge of HPC-specific programming models. (MPI, OpenMP.) I have been
  periodically involved in the MPI Forum to release the MPI 4.0 standard.
* Low-level system engineering (ELF rewriting)
* Basic server administation (Gitlab, SSH, DHCP...)

### > [2012 - 2015] -- *Work-Study program as part of Engineering School -- ECE Paris -- France*
With the advent of new methods of learning, I got the opportounity to study
through a Work-Study program. In that context, I joined the French leader
organization in HPC research, known as the ["Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique
et aux Énergies Alternatives"](https://www.cea.fr) and been associated with the
development of an MPI runtime called MPC. Among the goals I contributed to:
* Deployment of a standalone non-regression base for open-source applications,
  aware of HPC specifications and limitations.
* Study of several checkpoint-restart tools, to determine the best one to be
  used in place of the current method of checkpoint and restore applications
  inside the MPC framework.
* Development of a "test scheduler,” aware of HPC capacities and able to scale,
  allowing any CI system to optimize their time to result.

#### Personal Beliefs
- A coin always has two sides ; do not make a single version become the whole
  story.
- Validation & Documentation are fundamental pieces when developing any software
  and should not be infringed, *no matter what*
- People using `Fix bug` as a full commit message should be banned for life from
  using a keyboard.

- I (still) have a car driving license
- Deep interest into civil aviation
- Fan of Utah Jazz NBA team 
- Favorite color:  `#BF3030` or `rgb(191, 48, 48)` or `cmyk(0.00, 0.75, 0.75,
  0.25)`
- Lucky number: `0x4` or `0b100`
- Happily married with a wonderful wife
