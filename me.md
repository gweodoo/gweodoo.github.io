Professional Experience
============

### > [2019  - Present] -- *Teaching Assistant -- Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin (UVSQ) -- France*
Part of the High-Performance and Simulation (CHPS) Master Degree, the Advanced
Architecture of Operating Systems (AISE) lectures attempt to teach in a pratical
way the basics of Unix-like Operating Systems. Among the covererd subjects:
* Basics for Linux operatin systems (processes, threads, I/O, network)
* Compilation, Link and ELF program formatting
* Memory Management, from hardware to userspace
* Kernel (Customization, Scheduling, LKM, DKMS...)
Beyond lectures, I'm tutoring pluridisciplinary projects across the semester
(e.g. distributed KVS over MPI).In that context, I share the lead of this course
gathering around 45 hours of teaching a year.


### > [2015 - Present] -- *HPC Junior Developer & Consultant -- ParaTools SAS -- France*

As a individual part of this small company, the purpose of ParaTools is to
provide a highly specialized consulting support relatively to High performance
Computing solutions. More specifically, if this company was initially focused on
performance, thanks to the support the performance analysis tool, TAU. The
French affiliate covers a larger area, mainly focused on developing inside
runtimes (MPI, OpenMP). In that context, I contributed to multiple areas of
interest and feed my knowledge among the following:

* GCC and its overall compilation chain (front-ends, GIMPLE, IR, plugins...)
* High-speed networks through their optimization inside an MPI runtime (IB,
  Portals, SHMEM, OFI)
* Thread-level Storage mechanism through a complete rewrite of this support on
  top of hierarchical user-level thread model, mimicking the same capabilities
  as usually exposed with a regular `__thread` keyword. 
* Accelerators, mainly CUDA-capable oriented.
* Broad knowledge of HPC-specific programming models. (MPI, OpenMP.) Have been
  involved in the MPI Forum to release the MPI 4.0 standard.
* Low-level system engineering (ELF rewriting)


### > [2012 - 2015] -- *Apprenticeship as part of Engineering School -- ECE Paris -- France*
With the advent of new methods of learning, I got the change to almost make my
studies split half-time in school and as an internship in a company. In that
context, I joined a French leader in HPC research, known as the "Commissariat à
l'Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives" (aka CEA) and been associated
with the development of an MPI runtime called MPC. Among the goals I contributed
to:
* Deployment of a standalone non-regression base for open-source applications,
aware of HPC specifications and limitations.
* Study of several checkpoint-restart tools, to determine the best one to be
used in place of the current method of checkpoint and restore applications inside
  MPC.
* Development of a "test scheduler,” aware of HPC capacities and able to scale,
allowing any CI system to optimize their time to result.

#### Personal Beliefs
- Never consider a single piece of information as self-carrying the whole story.
- Validation & Documentation are fundamental pieces when developing any software
  and should not be infringed, *no matter what*
- People using `Fix bug` as a commit message should be banned for life from
  using a keyboard.
